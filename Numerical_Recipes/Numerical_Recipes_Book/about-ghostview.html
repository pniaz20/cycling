<b>Note: You don't need Ghostview/Ghostscript if you want
to download Numerical Recipes book sections and send them to
a PostScript printer.  Just save the files to disk and print them
as PostScript.</b><p>

PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated.<p>

<h1>Information on Ghostview/Ghostscript</h1>

Ghostscript is a freely available PostScript interpreter, with
versions for a number of different platforms.  Ghostview is
an additional driver program, also freely available, that uses
the Ghostscript engine to display multi-page PostScript documents
on your screen.
<p>

Neither of these programs are in any way connected to Numerical
Recipes Software.  We know that they can be tricky to install and get
running, but (sorry) we cannot provide any assistance in doing so.
There are active user groups on the net that can often be helpful,
e.g., gnu.ghostscript.bug and comp.lang.postscript.<p>

The first place to look for information on Ghostscript and Ghostview
is the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html"><b>Ghostscript
Home Page</b></a>.  Presumably, this information will be kept current
by its maintainers (not us!).  There is also a semi-commercial
(though unsupported) version, with better fonts, available by mail at
a reasonable price from
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/cd.html"> Aladdin
Enterprises</a>.<p>

Here are a few, some older, downloading points known to us at the time
of writing.  You want to get both Ghostscript (often named "gs261..."
or similar) and Ghostview (often named "gsview..." or similar) for
full effectiveness:<p>
